    "Imagine that you are working on a project with a very large codebase. At first, the code runs really well. Then, you develop a new feature, add some new files, and change some old code in the project. But now when you run your project again, it crashes. That's a big OOPS right there, and you just wish that you can go back to the older version of this project when it was still working.\n",

    "Luckily, Git allows you to save each version of your project into the Git system. If the new version does not work, you can always revert back to the older versions in a snap. Sounds cool ehhh?\n",

    "\n",

    "A __commit__ is basically a snapshot of your project folder. When you make a new commit, it's like you are taking a picture of your current project folder and saving it in the Git system. As we work on our project, we will have more commits (or snapshots) in the future. Of course, you can have a look at your old commits if you want too.\n",

    "<img src='./images/2-2.2.1-2-second_commit_node.png'/>\n",
    "\n",

You will see this when we practice with a real project folder in the [next section](#4).\n",

    "After checking that deleted file, let's say you want to get back to the most recent commit to continue working on the project. There is a fast way to do this.
